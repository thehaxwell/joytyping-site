import UserSettingsFileLocationInstruction from '../../../components/UserSettingsFileLocationInstruction.astro'

Set how fast mouse scrolling and mouse
cursor movements should be.

<UserSettingsFileLocationInstruction/>

Add the following under `[[profiles]]`. These values are the defaults. Start from here and adjust until you get a speed that you're comfortable with.
```
[profiles.stick_cardinal_levers.mouse_controls]
scroll_scale_factor = 1.0
cursor_move_scale_factor = 5.0
```
