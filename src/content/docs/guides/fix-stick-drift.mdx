Stick drift, also known as analog stick drift, is when a controller's thumbsticks seem to move on their own.

How do you know your controller may be suffering from stick drift while using Joytyping? Without you doing anything:
- Your mouse cursor moves
- The pages or windows you visit scroll vertically or horizontally
- Random or unexpeted letters are being typed

We can't help you fix your controller. But we can help you avoid being distrubed by it while you type.

First we need to find out how far the drift goes for affected sticks.

## 1. Diagnose the stick drift

Visit
<a href="https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad" target="_blank">this online controller tester</a>.

Plug in your controller and put it down once the website has detected it.

Read the numbers for AXIS 0 and AXIS 1. Are they moving away from `0.00000` automatically? If they are then wait for 2 minutes and note the highest number (treating negative numbers as positive numbers) you see among the two. We'll call this number the **drift upper limit** for the left stick.

Do the same with AXIS 2 and AXIS 3. The highest number you see among the two will be the **drift upper limit** for the right stick.

## 2. Deal with stick drift by creating a deadzone

To solve stick-drift, we'll create a deadzone from the stick's resting position (`0.0`) to the drift upper limits you got for the sticks when we [diagnosed the stick drift](#1-diagnose-the-stick-drift). 
Movements within the deadzone will be ignored.

We'll create this deadzone using user settings.

<UserSettingsFileLocationInstruction/>

Add the following under `[[profiles]]`.
For the values, use the drift upper limits you got for the sticks when we [diagnosed the stick drift](#1-diagnose-the-stick-drift).
```
[profiles.stick_cardinal_levers.deadzone_upper_limits]
left_stick = 0.0
right_stick = 0.0
```
