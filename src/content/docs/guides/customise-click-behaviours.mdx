Joytyping lets you type by clicking as you would expect
- the two sets of 4 buttons on the left and right sides of your controller
- the 4 triggers: R1, R2, L1 and L2.

## Clicking with sticks

Some layers in the layout you're using might allow you to use the left and right sticks like buttons: tilting past a certain point in a direction triggers a click.

![Left and right sticks both at 0.5 all-round thresholds](/std-at-rest.svg)

```
[profiles.stick_switches.click_thresholds]
left_stick_up = 0.5
left_stick_down = 0.5
left_stick_left = 0.5
left_stick_right = 0.5
right_stick_up = 0.5
right_stick_down = 0.5
right_stick_left = 0.5
right_stick_right = 0.5
```

Here's an example of "clicking" right with the left stick

![Left and right sticks both at 0.5 all-round thresholds. Left clicks east](/std-left-clicks-east.svg)

Define how far a stick must be pushed 
in each direction to be counted as a "click". 
Choose values between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).


## When to recognize double-clicks and click-and-holds

```
[profiles.switch_click_event_thresholds]
minimum_milliseconds_down_for_click_and_hold = 500
maximum_milliseconds_between_clicks_for_double_click = 500
```

## Clicking with triggers

Define how far a trigger-2 (L2 or R2) must be 
pressed down to be counted as a "click". 
Choose values between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
```
[profiles.trigger_2_switches.click_thresholds]
left_trigger_2 = 0.3
right_trigger_2 = 0.3
```
