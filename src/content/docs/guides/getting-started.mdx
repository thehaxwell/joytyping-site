Joytyping needs settings to know how to work the way you prefer. There are user settings and layout settings. We'll help you set those up.

## 1. Setup user settings

If you're running Windows, create the joytyping folder so that it's located here:
`C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\joytyping`

If you're running linux, create the joytyping directory so that it's located here:
`/home/yourusername/.config/joytyping`

Remember to replace "yourusername" with your actual username.

Now in the joytyping folder you just created, you'll add your user settings file.
Make a file called `user.toml` with the following contents:

```
[global]
default_profile= "first profile"

[[profiles]]
name="first profile"
layout_settings_relative_file_path="vallack-layout/main.toml"

# Set to true if your controller's d-pad is above the 
# left-stick, like a Playstation controller.
# Set to false if the d-pad is below the left-stick,
# like a XBox controller.
left_upper_is_d_pad = true
```

## 2. Setup layout settings

[Download the layout as a zip folder](https://github.com/thehaxwell/vallack-layout/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.0.zip). We're starting you out with [the Vallack layout](https://github.com/thehaxwell/vallack-layout).

Unzip the contents of the zip folder in the joytyping folder so that it looks like this.
```
joytyping
├── start.toml
└── vallack-layout
    ├── main.toml
    ...
```

## You're ready

That's it! If you followed these steps correctly then you can run Joytyping, connect your gaming-controller, and start typing.
