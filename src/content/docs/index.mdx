## Get rid of the pains that come with working at your desk

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="End forearm pronation pains" icon="right-caret">
Typing on regular keyboards forces you to twist your wrists inward to make your palms face down. This position leads to forearm pronation pains. But your controller lets you keep a natural and painless position with your palms facing each other.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Bye-bye back aches" icon="right-caret">
Using a keyboard keeps you to hunched over in the same sedentary position for a long time while you work. But using a controller held in your hands frees you to lean back and shift positions, relieving back pains.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Escape pinkie pains" icon="right-caret">
Someone thought it would be a good idea to put keys like shift and control at the edges to be held down using your weakest fingers - the pinkie fingers. It was a bad, painful idea. Typing using a controller will give your strongest fingers the heavy lifting instead.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Forget forearm pains" icon="right-caret">
When reaching for your keyboard, it's tempting to rest your forearms against your desk edge all day. Give in to the temptation and your forearms will get painful. With typing with a controller you can get rid of the temptation altogether.

## Joytyping is super customisable
- Assign any character to the click- or double-click of controller buttons - even shortcuts like Ctrl-Z(undo)
- Our flexible and generous layers system lets you define hundreds of layers that you can navigate between in many ways
- The quick-lookup-window is a window you can bring up on your screen while typing to check how to type the key you're looking for. This window is made of html, css and js so it's completely customisable
